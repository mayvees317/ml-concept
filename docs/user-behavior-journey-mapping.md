TRIGGER: Competing timelines between children's education needs and retirement savings
INPUTS: Children's ages, education timeline, retirement timeline, resource limitations
STEPS:
1. Realize timeline conflicts → Children need education now, retirement later
2. Prioritize children's immediate needs → Short-term thinking
3. Ignore retirement timeline → "I'll worry about that later"
4. Reach retirement age unprepared → Too late to adequately prepare
OUTPUTS: Retirement inadequacy, timeline optimization failure, intergenerational resource conflicts
```

**FUTURE STATE:**
```
TRIGGER: Timeline optimization with intergenerational planning
INPUTS: All family timelines, optimization opportunities, Vietnamese intergenerational strategies, creative solutions
PROCESSING: Multi-timeline optimization, intergenerational planning, resource maximization
STEPS:
1. Map all competing timelines → Clear picture of resource competition
2. See intergenerational optimization strategies → How to honor both timelines
3. Implement creative resource solutions → Alternative approaches to timeline conflicts
4. Execute optimized intergenerational plan → Both education and retirement adequately funded
OUTPUTS: Optimized intergenerational planning, timeline conflict resolution, multi-generational security
```
