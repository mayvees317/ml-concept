2. **Consideration:** Downloads 5 apps, keeps all in free mode
3. **Purchase:** 99% never purchase; 1% buy during promotion then cancel
4. **Onboarding:** Tries manual entry, gives up after day 3
5. **Usage:** Opens app once a month when feeling guilty
6. **Advocacy:** Only if incentivized (referral rewards)

**Survival Tactic:** Focus on day 1 value and ad impressions, abandon complex onboarding

**B2B Journey (Cost-Minimization Path):**

2. **Consideration:** Compares 5 vendors, 2 open-source options, internal build
3. **Purchase:** Negotiates 70% discount, monthly contract, success metrics

### Strategic Implications for Survival

   - Must expand to India/Africa
   - Or focus on one city deeply
